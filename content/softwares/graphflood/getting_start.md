# Quick Start

While I am still constructing the documentation I provide on this page quick ways to use `graphflood`.

**You need to have**:

- **2D topography** (DEM file, premade function, anything that provide a 2D regular grid of elevation)
- **Precipitation rates** (scalar, 2D array)
- **Manning** coefficient (scalar, 2D array) -> 0.033 is a commonly accepted value in rivers
- [if needed] *2D Boundary conditions*
- [If not done yet] [`scabbard` installed](/softwares/scabbard/) 

**You need to now**

- Every backend has different pros and cons and may produce slightly different results.
- `gpu` backend is a lot faster, but you need a **GPU** with enough memory
- `graphflood` is iterative, you need to decide on a convergence criterion (easy solution: run until the flow depth stabilises)
- Higher `dt` = faster convergence, but more instabilities. I am working on adding automatic `dt` and convergence detection.

## Simple Setup

<div class="main-paragraph" style="background-color: gray;">
    <p>DEM has no NoData, flow can out from every edges of the model</p>
    <p>Default Boundary Conditions</p>
</div>

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import taichi as ti
import scabbard as scb


# Loading the DEM
grid = scb.io.load_raster('dem.tif')


# Change this variable to change the backend:

## GPU backend with taichi 
### (if you have a MAC this remains untested but theoretically works)
### (If you are on Linux/Windows WITHOUT Nvidia GPU, you need to install the vulkan SDK/drivers -> https://vulkan.lunarg.com/)
# backend = 'gpu'
# ti.init('gpu')
## CPU backend with DAGGER (OG graphflood - both options work)
# backend = 'cpu'
# backend = 'dagger'

## CPU libTopoToolbox backend
backend = 'ttb'

# running Graphflood dor 1000 iterations
results = scb.graphflood.std_run(
    grid, # Sting or grid so far
    P = 1e-4, # precipitations, 2D numpy array or scalar
    BCs = None, # Boundary codes
    N_dt = 500,
    backend = backend,
    dt = 1e-2,
    init_hw = None) # init_hw can be a 2D array of DEM dimension with pre-existing flow depth. For example if you want to continue a run

fig,ax = scb.visu.hillshaded_basemap(grid)


hw = results['h'].Z.copy() # if ttb is used, results arrays are topotoolbox GridObj
hw[hw<0.01] = np.nan
im = ax.imshow(hw, cmap = 'Blues', vmax = 3., extent = grid.geo.extent, alpha = 0.75)
plt.colorbar(im, label = 'Flow Depth (m)')
plt.show()
```


## Isolating sub-section of a DEM

<div class="main-paragraph" style="background-color: gray;">
    <p>DEM has NoData, or for any other reason will not consider some nodes (e.g. bellow sea level, only the main watershed, ...)</p>
    <p>Use of automatic functions to set up the Boundary Conditions</p>
</div>

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import taichi as ti
import scabbard as scb


# Loading the DEM
grid = scb.io.load_raster('dem.tif')

# Isolating the main drainage basin
## this function returns a mask of 0,1 showing the main watershed
mask = scb.flow.mask_main_basin(grid, MFD = False)
## You could also, alternatively, mask seas in case you wanna remove all the data below a certain values
# mask = mask_seas(grid, sea_level = 0.)

## Encode the mask into boundary conditions
BCs = scb.flow.mask_to_BCs(grid,mask)

# Change this variable to change the backend:

## GPU backend with taichi 
### (if you have a MAC this remains untested but theoretically works)
### (If you are on Linux/Windows WITHOUT Nvidia GPU, you need to install the vulkan SDK/drivers -> https://vulkan.lunarg.com/)
backend = 'gpu'
## CPU backend with DAGGER (OG graphflood - both options work)
# backend = 'cpu'
# backend = 'dagger'

## CPU libTopoToolbox backend
# backend = 'ttb'

# running Graphflood dor 1000 iterations
results = scb.graphflood.std_run(
    grid, # Sting or grid so far
    P = 1e-4, # precipitations, numpy array or scalar
    BCs = BCs, # Boundary codes
    N_dt = 5000,
    backend = backend,
    dt = 1e-2,
    init_hw = None)

fig,ax = scb.visu.hillshaded_basemap(grid)


hw = results['h'].copy()
hw[hw<0.01] = np.nan
im = ax.imshow(hw, cmap = 'Blues', vmax = 3., extent = grid.geo.extent, alpha = 0.75)
plt.colorbar(im, label = 'Flow Depth (m)')
plt.show()




```
