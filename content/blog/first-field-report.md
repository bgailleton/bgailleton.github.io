**Setup**

- Location: Riverside test plot.
- Sensors: 6 multi-spectral units + 1 thermal camera.
- Weather: Cloudy, intermittent drizzle.

**Observations**

- The ATLAS CLI saved ~35 minutes by auto-generating manifests for the dusk passes.
- Manual annotations lagged because the upload queue filled; need to prioritize the comment bot work.
- Surprisingly low noise on the thermal channel. Worth a deeper sweep this week.

Next steps live inside the Spectral Field Notes wiki entry so everything stays connected.
