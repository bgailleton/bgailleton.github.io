The site finally brings everything under one roof: briefs for active projects, documentation for the software stack, a CV snapshot, and a publication list that stays current. The home page gives collaborators a quick sense of what is alive, while deeper links remain one click away.

**What to expect next**

- Streamlined changelog posts as tools evolve.
- Monthly summaries that tie together datasets, code releases, and field notes.
- Lightweight wiki pages that eventually turn into proper docs.
