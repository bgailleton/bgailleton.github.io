description = "Researcher at the Université de Rennes, I am a geomorphologist and numerical modeller investigating the links between climate, tectonics and surface processes. I develop and apply topographic analysis and landscape evolution modelling methods that incorporate shallow water flow to large-scale, long-term landscape evolution, aiming to quantitatively unravel the climatic and tectonic conditions that shaped their genesis and to predict how these landscapes will respond to changes in climatic and tectonic forcing."

Welcome to the lab notebook on the web. Every section is intentionally scoped: research pages read like concise briefs, software entries behave like living documentation, and the blog doubles as a wiki when ideas are still messy. Replace any placeholder text as soon as you have real updates—most blocks are ready for copy/paste from your working documents.

To add more news items, duplicate a `[[news]]` block above and set `date`, `title`, `summary`, plus optional `link`, `cta`, and `variant` (`glow`, `glass`, or `wire` for contrasting treatments).
