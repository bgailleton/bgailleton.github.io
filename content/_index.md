description = "Researcher at the Université de Rennes, I am a geomorphologist and numerical modeler trying to understand the links between climates, tectonics and surface processes. I am actively developping and applying topographic analysis and landscape evolution modelling methods incorporating shallow water flow to large-scale/long-term landscapes evolution and quantitative description to unravel the climatic and tectonic conditions that led to their genesis or how they will react to a change of climatic and tectonic forcings."

Welcome to the lab notebook on the web. Every section is intentionally scoped: research pages read like concise briefs, software entries behave like living documentation, and the blog doubles as a wiki when ideas are still messy. Replace any placeholder text as soon as you have real updates—most blocks are ready for copy/paste from your working documents.
