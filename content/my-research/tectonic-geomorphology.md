## Focus

We concentrate on three fault corridors—Apennines, central Anatolia, and the Taiwan orogen—to understand how uplift rates leak into fluvial knickzones. Each corridor mixes cosmogenic nuclide sampling, differential GPS, and drone-based photogrammetry to capture both the long-term and event-scale story.

- **Slip partitioning**: comparing terrace chronologies with balanced cross sections.
- **Drainage fingerprints**: chi-analysis plus TopoToolbox metrics aggregated along tributary sets.
- **Hazard framing**: convert reconstructed erosion histories into planners' language.

## Methods Stack

1. Terrestrial lidar + RTK surveys to capture micro-topography of fault scarps.
2. Python notebooks that co-register cosmogenic samples with modeled uplift histories.
3. Bayesian inversion routines (DynEarthSol + bespoke priors) to test tectonic scenarios.

## What's Next

- Wrap the Apennines dataset into an interactive atlas so collaborators can annotate hypotheses inline.
- Deploy low-power GNSS beacons across the Anatolia transect to watch seasonal strain swings.
- Release templated figure scripts (Python + GMT) that enforce reproducible plots across the team.
