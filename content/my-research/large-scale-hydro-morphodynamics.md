## Scope

This is my main research project and likely the leitmotif of my career. Simulating river hydrodynamics and morphodynamics — computing flow depth, velocity and shear stress fields, as well as sediment transport through space and time for a given discharge — is essential for analysing fluvial processes across scales, beyond simple mass-balance budgets. However, the need to solve the computationally demanding Shallow Water Equations restricts current models (e.g., [Delft3D](https://oss.deltares.nl/web/delft3d/get-started), [HEC-RAS](https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/)) to small spatial domains and short timescales. To fully exploit high-resolution DSMs and capture fluvial processes over geological times, new efficient methods are required to derive high-resolution hydrologic and morphologic metrics from large datasets using physics-based approaches.

These methods are critical to address major unresolved questions related to multi-scale behaviour: how much of the present-day topography reflects long-term tectonic and climatic evolution versus the imprint of extreme floods? Can the frequency and magnitude of extreme floods be inferred from topography alone? Are morpho-sedimentary records truly representative of tectonic and climatic conditions, or do they merely stochastically record isolated events?

This project leverages a major shift in data availability. Geomorphology at global scale has long relied on low-resolution DEMs (e.g. 30 m SRTM) where most rivers are sub-pixel. Today, satellites such as [Pléiades Neo](https://space-solutions.airbus.com/imagery/our-optical-and-radar-satellite-imagery/pleiades-neo/) provide metre-scale DSMs with repeated temporal coverage. Even higher resolutions are achieved through airborne LiDAR, with national-scale programmes becoming increasingly common (e.g. LiDAR HD in France, and comparable initiatives in Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Germany, the USA and New Zealand).

**We are not limited by data availability anymore, but by our ability to process and analyse it.**
