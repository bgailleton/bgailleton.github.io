I am a postdoctoral researcher at the GFZ institute, in the [Earth Surface Process Modelling section](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/sektion/erdoberflaechenprozessmodellierung/ueberblick/). My main work at the moment is the development of a semi-Lagrangian Landscape Evolution Model, in order to being able to (i) separate all fluxes dynamically (e.g. water and sediments), (ii) adapt spatially and dynamically flexible sets of surface processes laws while (iii) maintaining full source-to-sink tracking of provenance and deposition, together with Luca Malatesta, Jean Braun and Guillaume Cordonnier. In other words, we plan to run particules of surface-processes on my landscapes and apply all equation at each movement of these. It will allow us to always know the composition of these particules in term of water, sediment or any other elements no matter which law is utilised. We can threfore dynamically manage lake filling and deposition, as we always know how much water we have when reaching a lake bottom for exemple; or adapt the model behavior function of the composition of the sediment flux.

I did my PhD at the University of Edinburgh with Simon Mudd, Hugh Sinclair and Mikael Attal, focusing on extracting geomorphometrics in lithologically and/or tectonically heterogeneous landscapes, in order to unravel both signals from the shape of the river network. Three publications are in the pipeline in this general purpose of dealing with complex landscapes. _De facto_, and courtesy to Prof. Mudd, I spent most of my time coding in `python` and `c++` within the [LSDTopoTools](https://lsdtopotools.github.io) framework (and particularly enjoyed it). I wrote a python binder for these tools, `lsdtopytools`, available cross-platform from `conda-forge` and binding the main fluvial algorithms for LSDTopoTools.

I plan in this website to write few blog posts about `python`, `c++` LEMs, DEMs, topographic analysis and LSDTopoTools. Or not. I plan to, at least the intention is there.
