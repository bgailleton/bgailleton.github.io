I am a PhD student in tectonic geomorphology, studying the relationship between tectonic activity and the shape of surface topography. My PhD has two main focus: (i) developing and testing topographic analysis algorithm to describe the Earth surface and relate it to tectonics; (ii) Applying these in the Romanian Carpathians, where topographic response to active tectonics is complicated by lithologic contrasts. On this website you can find:

1. Details about my research projects on my Research page where I am explaining in more details my current, past and maybe future work;
1. My CV if you are interested by my career path;
1. My Publication record
1. Blog posts about my research and about coding: a significant part of my PhD has been about learning, using and developing topographic analysis codes in `python` and `c++` and I like to think that other people might be interested by these (don't tell me if I am wrong).
