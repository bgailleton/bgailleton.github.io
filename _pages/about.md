I am a postdoctoral researcher at the GFZ institute, in the [Earth Surface Process Modelling section](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/staff/boris-gailleton/). My main research focus is on developing methods, algorithms and research software packages to deal with digital topography, _i.e._ either to process existing analysis with topographic analysis, or to simulate topography with landscape evolution models. 

<!-- Feel free to have a look on my [Research Projects]https://bgailleton.github.io/Research/) for details! -->

# Research Softwares

Here is a very brief summary of my ongoing, mature and/or side software projects. Feel free to contact me if any of those is interesting for you, the amount of work I put in each is dependent on my ongoing projects!

## Topographic Analysis

- [LSDTopoTools](https://lsdtopotools.github.io): I actively worked on the core development of LSDTopoTools, a c++ framework to process topographic analysis for which I developped a lot of tools around the use of Chi coordinate, channel steepness, concavity index, watershed identification or other general-purpose geomorphic algorithm.

- `lsdtopytools`: a python binding of LSDTopoTools bringing a number of LSDTopoTools to interactive python using `xtensor`.

# Research Software in the pipeline

I have several research softwares in the pipeline: (i) `name_to_be_determine_v1` which is a `c++` + `xsimlab` code prototyping my postdoc model (80% finished, publication to come soon hopefully), (ii) `name_to_be_determine_v2` which will follow shortly after and will be a full `python` and generic version of that model to allow further developments, optimisations and friendliness of the code (for users and myself) and (iii) `lsdnumbatools` or `xarray-lsd` a full `python` engine for topographic analysis part of the `LSDTopoTools` framework (more to come soon, I don;t want to oversell it).

I plan in this website to write few blog posts about `python`, `c++` LEMs, DEMs, topographic analysis and LSDTopoTools. Or not. I plan to, at least the intention is there.
