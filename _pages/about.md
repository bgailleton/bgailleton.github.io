# Current position: Post-Doctoral researcher at the GFZ

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the GFZ institute, in the [Earth Surface Process Modelling section](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/sektion/erdoberflaechenprozessmodellierung/ueberblick/). My main work at the moment is the development of a framework for Landscape Evolution Modelling designed for studying complex landscapes together with Luca Malatesta, Jean Braun and Guillaume Cordonnier. By complex landscapes, I mean landscapes where such things as internal lakes, lithologic heterogeneity or complex feedbacks between tools and cover are complexifying the whole source-to-sink system. The technical principle is simple: we plan to run particules of surface-processes on the landscapes and apply all equations at each movement of these. It will allow us to always know the composition of these particules in term of water, sediment or any other elements no matter which law is utilised. We can threfore dynamically manage lake filling and deposition, or adapt the model behavior function of the composition of the sediment flux.

# PhD at the University of Edinburgh

I did my PhD at the University of Edinburgh with Simon Mudd, Hugh Sinclair and Mikael Attal, focusing on extracting geomorphometrics in lithologically and/or tectonically heterogeneous landscapes, in order to unravel both signals from the shape of the river network. Three publications are in the pipeline in this general purpose of dealing with complex landscapes. _De facto_, and courtesy to Prof. Mudd, I spent most of my time coding in `python` and `c++` within the [LSDTopoTools](https://lsdtopotools.github.io) framework, the fastscape framework as well as my own ones. I wrote a `python` binder for these tools, `lsdtopytools`, available cross-platform from `conda-forge` and binding the main fluvial algorithms for LSDTopoTools. 

# Research Software in the pipeline

I have several research softwares in the pipeline: (i) `name_to_be_determine_v1` which is a `c++` + `xsimlab` code prototyping my postdoc model (80% finished, publication to come soon hopefully), (ii) `name_to_be_determine_v2` which will follow shortly after and will be a full `python` and generic version of that model to allow further developments, optimisations and friendliness of the code (for users and myself) and (iii) `lsdnumbatools` or `xarray-lsd` a full `python` engine for topographic analysis part of the `LSDTopoTools` framework (more to come soon, I don;t want to oversell it).

I plan in this website to write few blog posts about `python`, `c++` LEMs, DEMs, topographic analysis and LSDTopoTools. Or not. I plan to, at least the intention is there.
